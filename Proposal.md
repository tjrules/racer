##I would like to create solitaire. I don’t know if the logic is too difficult to for me to figure out. But it doesn’t seem that hard. I want to make it like traditional solitaire where you drag cards in sequential order on top of each other. I think the MVP would be to just have the regular game working. If I had time I would add the dancing cards across the screen when you win, and do three draw solitaire, and have a score.
